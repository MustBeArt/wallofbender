## Introduction

The **Wall of Bender** is a logger and display board for the
[AND!XOR DC25 Badge](https://hackaday.io/project/19121-andxor-dc25-badge),
aka the Bender Badge at
[DEFCON](https://www.defcon.org) 25
(2017 at Caesar's Palace). The badge has a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
radio, which it uses to implement a multiplayer botnet game between the
badges (among other things). Each badge is constantly transmitting its
unique ID, player name, and other game info in BLE advertisement format.
The Wall listens for these advertisements, logs them all to a file, and
displays them in a friendly format for the amusement and edification of
passers-by.

Three windows are displayed. A smaller window displays just the names and
unique IDs of each and every badge advertisement received, in real time,
even if they go by too fast to read. A bigger window displays the same
information plus a time-since-last-heard indication, and smooth scrolls
the entire stored list, after removing duplicates based on the BLE
advertising address transmitted. In between, another smooth-scrolled
window shows just the names received, regardless of which badge sent them.

## Hardware

We deployed the Wall of Bender on a
[Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/),
which has its own built-in Bluetooth hardware. Any Linux-based computer
with a Bluetooth adapter capable of supporting BLE under the standard
[BlueZ Bluetooth stack](http://www.bluez.org) should theoretically work fine.

We used a [LG 24M38H](http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-24M38H-B-led-monitor)
HDMI monitor at 1920x1080 ("Full HD" 1080P) resolution. Note that the Wall
of Bender is hard-coded for this resolution and will look terrible at any
other resolution.

## Deployment Notes

### Operating System

We used
[NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-noobs/) 2.4.2 to install
[Raspbian](http://raspbian.org) Jessie on an 8GB SD card.

### Permissions

The Wall of Bender needs networking permissions to operate the Bluetooth
interface. This could be accomplished by running as `root` but that's a
bad idea. Instead, we want to grant ourselves the appropriate capabilities.
But we're a script running under the Python interpreter, so actually we
needed to grant those capabilities to the interpreter. We didn't want to do
that for every Python program, so we made a private copy of the interpreter
and granted the capabilities to that. Like so:

```
	cp /usr/bin/python3 capython3
	sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' capython3
```

We then put that private interpreter in the shebang line at the top of
`wallofbender.py`, so it gets the needed permissions if run like so:

```
	./wallofbender.py
```

### Dependencies

```
	sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk
```

Everything else needed was already included in the NOOBS install of
Raspbian.

### Screen Blanking

We turned off screen blanking as suggested on
[this web page](http://www.geeks3d.com/hacklab/20160108/how-to-disable-the-blank-screen-on-raspberry-pi-raspbian/)
by adding

```
    [SeatDefaults]
    xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms
```

in the file `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf `.

### WiFi

We investigated the possibility of creating the UI as a web page. This was
rejected for the primary UI because the Raspberry Pi seems to be too slow
to run the web browser quickly, and because making the UI look good in the
time available was beyond my skill level as a web developer. I installed
[hostapd](http://w1.fi/hostapd/) to create a standalone network for the
Wall. Following recipes found web pages like
[this one](https://seravo.fi/2014/create-wireless-access-point-hostapd),
I got it working, but it always failed to start hostapd on boot. Starting
hostapd manually after boot worked.

The Wall was serving a web page during the deployment, but it didn't have
any live data on it, so we didn't mention it to anyone.

### Non-Bender Badges

Some of the other unofficial badges at DEFCON 25 were using a compatible
BLE protocol and could interact with the Bender badges. Those transmissions
are not logged by the Wall of Bender, because of the fields within the
advertisement format I chose to filter on.

### Crash Recovery

The Wall of Bender is designed to clean up after itself when stopped with
control-C or `kill`, but if it crashes after initializing the Bluetooth
interface it may leave the interface in an unusable condition. It can
usually be recovered like so:

```
	sudo hciconfig hci0 down
	sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

If that doesn't work, a reboot probably will.

We didn't experience any crashes with the final Python script.

## Results

The Wall of Bender received 359,838 badge advertisements during DEFCON 25,
including a little bit of testing in the hotel room.

214 unique Advertising IDs were seen, which probably (?) means 214 actual
unique badges. 221 unique 16-bit hardware IDs were seen. The extra 7
hardware IDs are due to spoofing. Only 209 unique Names were seen; many
of the names recorded were either the default names or names that had
been changed to a fixed value by a game attack.

In a number of the received advertisements, the Local Name field was
replaced with an unknown advertising data type, 0x7c, and a payload of
0x5f5f5f5f5f5f5c. I don't know the purpose of these packets.

The log files are found in the
[logfile archive (.zip)](https://github.com/MustBeArt/wallofbender/blob/master/logfiles.zip).

### Log File Format

The Wall writes a file for each thousand badge advertisements received.
The file is plain text. Each line consists of a timestamp as a floating
point count of seconds (Unix timestamp) and a string of hex representing
the raw data in the advertisement.

### Timestamp Limitation

I failed to account for the fact that the Raspberry Pi Zero W does not
include a realtime clock. Since the Wall did not have access to the Internet
-- that's a *feature* when you're deployed at DEFCON in the Wireless
Village! -- it could not set its own clock by NTP, as a Linux host normally
would. So, all the timestamps are wrong.
